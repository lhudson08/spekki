## Usage

FIXME

## Etymology

The word `spekki` is an [Aussie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie)-sounding 
word I chose to be unique-ish in
Google and also look a bit like the word "species". It also happens to be
similar to the Norse word "[speki](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/speki)" 
which means "wise". I can only hope the software lives up to its name.
